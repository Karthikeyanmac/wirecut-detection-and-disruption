# wirecut-detection-and-disruption
The Wirecut Detection and Disruption Simulator is a simulation tool designed to model and analyze scenarios where wirecuts occur, and the subsequent detection and disruption responses. This project aims to provide a robust platform for simulating various wirecut incidents and their impacts on systems.
